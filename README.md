# Terre ⛰️

---
Terre is a rust-wgpu based voxel game under development.  
This project is for my personal learning of rust, graphics, ecs, game engine, etc.

Some dev-logs are published on my [blog](http://koiro.xyz).

## Main libraries used
- [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu): cross-platform graphics api.
- [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit): cross-platform window creation and management in Rust.
- [hecs](https://github.com/Ralith/hecs): high-performance, minimalist ECS.
- [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui): easy-to-use GUI in pure Rust.
